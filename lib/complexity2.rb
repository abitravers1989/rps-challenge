# The last two classes here are clearly different. In fact
# they aren't good â€” there's duplication and you can see
# how the number of classes would grow out of control.

# What we would really do at this point is extract the data
# to a configuration file or a database and write a few
# classes to convert it into the right objects.

# But for the purposes of the exercise, I've not done that :)
